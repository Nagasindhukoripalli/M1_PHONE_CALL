Industry projects opten have 5000 to 5 millons of source lines of code and writing everything under one single file is not reader friendly and also it is east to get lost
A simple solution is to divide  the code into multiple files.
main division in that multifile is for header file
header files are placed in c
functions calling process are used in that multifile so it is placed in src
Along with that i can use unity file for testing
